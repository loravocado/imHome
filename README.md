# imHome
Inspiration:
It is really important to me that I know all my friends are getting home safe after going out late into the night. While it may seem like a small gesture, many of my friends and I make sure to ask each other whether we have gotten home safely. A couple years ago, a friend of mine who often stays out late, didn't arrive at her house one night after hanging out with her friends. Not only until the morning did her friends realise that she was actually missing. This project was made to prevent cases like these and to notify friends/family as soon as someone goes missing rather than possibly 8 hours later.

What it does:
imHome is a simple app that uses your location from your phone as you are starting to make your trip home from your event. From here, it calculates how long it'll take to get from your location to your house. You can type in a series of contacts which you would like to notify, and after around 1.5-2x the estimated arrival time, the app will check for your location. If your location is at home, it'll notify your selected contacts that you've made it home. If your location is not at home, it'll let your selected contacts know that you seem to not be at home yet.

How we built it:
The app is built in React Native, the database APIs were built using the Standard Library, geolocation was from google-maps API and the server we used was Node.JS.

Challenges we ran into
Our team knew very little about the technologies we were working with. We had limited knowledge in creating apps, React Native, using any sort of APIs, creating APIs (we didn't even know what an API really was), or even JavaScript.

Accomplishments that we are proud of
I am proud that we have a functioning product

What we learned
I have learned so much about the development process. As well, I learned that it is perfectly okay to walk into a project not knowing how to do anything.

What's next for imHome
I would like for the app to be able to read straight from your contacts list rather than manually typing in numbers and a way for the app to notify the authorities if you are missing for a certain amount of time. Also, making a more user friendly interface
